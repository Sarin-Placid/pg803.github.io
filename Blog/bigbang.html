            <h2>All about the Big Bang and cosmic Inflation (And more) </h2>
            <p><i>Disclamer: This page is incomplete and likely won't be for a while, this is a huge topic</i></p>
            <p>The big bang is something we all have heard of. We all know that it was the event that causes the formation of the universe,
                but there is a lot more to it than just that; Have you ever heard of cosmic inflation? Baryogenesis? Why the
                bang theory is widely accepted to this day unlife the likes of its rivals like the steady state theory? that is what this 
                article is about. <br><br><br></p>

                an image showing the timeline of the universe from the Big Bang. As you can see, the universe rapidly expanded in size in 
                the first seconds of its existence. <br> <br>
            </p>
            <p> With that Introduction out of the way, let's dive in to it. First off, lets make it clear what exactly the Big Bang is. 
                The Big Bang Theory is a theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initil state of high density and temperature.
                It is the most widely accepted comsological model and it explains the evolution of the observable universe from very early on from 
                its creation. It is popular as it explains a lot of observed phenomena: The abundance of light elements, the Cosmic microwave raidtion
                and large scale structure are some examples. critically, it agrees with the Hubble-Lema√Ætre law, which is the observation that
                galaxies are moving away from Earth, and the further away they are, the faster they are receding.</p>
