            <h2>The Big Bang and more, briefly</h2>
            <p><i>Disclamer: This page is incomplete and likely won't be for a while, this is a huge topic</i></p>
            <p>The Big Bang is something we all have heard of. We all know that it was the event that causes the formation of the universe,
                but there is a lot more to it than just that; Have you ever heard of cosmic inflation? Baryogenesis? Why the
                bang theory is widely accepted to this day unlife the likes of its rivals like the steady state theory? that is what this 
                article is about. <br><br><br></p>

                an image showing the timeline of the universe from the Big Bang. As you can see, the universe rapidly expanded in size in 
                the first seconds of its existence. <br> <br>
            </p>
            <p> With that Introduction out of the way, let's dive in to it. First off, lets make it clear what exactly the Big Bang is. 
                The Big Bang Theory is a theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.
                It is the most widely accepted comsological model and it explains the evolution of the observable universe from very early on from 
                its creation.
            </p>
            <p>It is popular as it explains a lot of observed phenomena: The abundance of light elements, the Cosmic microwave raidtion
                and large scale structure are some examples. critically, it agrees with the Hubble-Lemaître law, which is the observation that
                galaxies are moving away from Earth, and the further away they are, the faster they are receding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Big Bang theory depends on two assumptions to work: The universality of physical laws and the comsological principle. 
                The universality of physical laws is one of the crucial principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle 
                states that the universe, on large scales, is homogeneous and isotropic, or in other words, it appears the same in all directions
                no matter what the locaton is. And we know these assumptions are most likely true: The first assumption has been tested by observations
                showing that the largest possible change in the fine-structure constant over the age of the universe is of order 10^-5. Also,
                General Relativty has passed many difficult tests over the years. And since the universe appears isotropic from Earth, if the 
                Copernician principle, which states that there is no special observer or vantage point, the universe may indeed be isotropic, which
                confirms the cosmological principle.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to the expansion of space, general relativity describes spacetime by a metric, which determines the distances
                that seperate nearby "points", which are specified using a coordinate chart. The cosmological principle singles out the 
                Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, which describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding (or otherwise, contracting) universe.
                The metric contains a "scale factor" which describes how the universe's size changes with time. it allows the creation of a coordinate system
                called comoving coordinates, where the grid expands with the universe. Also, a common misunderstanding, the Big Bang is not an explosion in space,
                but rather an expansion of space. matter does not move outward to fill an empty universe, space itself expands and increases the physical
                distances between comoving points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important feature is Horizons.  Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, 
                there may be events in the past whose light has not yet had time to reach us. This places a limit on the most distant objects that can be observed. 
                Also, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emmited by these objects will never reach us.

                Singularity
            </h4>    
            <p>
                Seeing the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity, we end up with infinite density and temperature
                at a point in the past. This gravitational singularity shows that general relativty is not an adequate description of the laws of physics 
                in these situations. A unified field theory unifying gravity with the other three interactions would be needed to describe these situations
                The age of the universe has been found as 13.8 billion years based on measurements of the universe's expansion using Type Ia supernovae and 
                measurements of temperature fluctutations in the cosmic microwave background.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite being extremely dense at this time, 
                the universe did not re-collapse into a singularity. Since the early universe did not immediately collapse into many black holes, 
                matter at that time must have been very evenly distributed with a very small density gradient.
